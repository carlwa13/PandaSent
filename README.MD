# PandaSent: Hate Speech Detection Project

## Description

Welcome to PandaSent, a hate speech detection project developed by CawaTech! As a young enthusiast in machine learning and natural language processing, I've embarked on this journey to explore various methods for hate speech detection and compare their effectiveness.

This project is not just about building a hate speech detection model; it's about my journey of growth and learning in the field of machine learning. I aim to delve into different machine learning models, experiment with various techniques, and gain insights into the complex problem of hate speech detection.

It's important to note that none of the [datasets]((Datasets.MD)) used in this project are not mine.
